Hi! Thank you for choosing winehq-installer as a way to automate many wine-related processes.
This is all the information You need to know about this application. Not to be confused with "README.md" as that file is for display in github.

wine-installer-ubuntu.sh -> This script can be used for installing wine on ubuntu & and ubuntu based distributions.

wine-installer-debian -> This script can be used for installing wine on debian & debian based distributions (With a few exceptions like ubuntu).

wine-installer-fedora.sh -> This script can be used for installing wine on fedora & and fedora based distributions

Any bugs found in the script report to "https://github.com/RishonDev/winehq-installer/issues" immediately(This requires a github account) Under Issues > New issue.
Any questions can be asked in the same way.
